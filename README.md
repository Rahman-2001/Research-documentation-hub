# Research-&-documentation-hub
Research and Documentation Hub is a digital platform designed to showcase and preserve my fieldwork journey as a Masterâ€™s student. Every day, I engage in practical field activities, capturing meaningful photographs and preparing reports that reflect my learning, observations, and contributions in the community.
